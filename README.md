third project of "AI and the Web"

### Project 3: Web Services

Work on the following two tasks for the distributed message board environment presented in the seminar:

Code: https://studip.uni-osnabrueck.de/sendfile.php?type=0&file_id=a1bc74c9b9384a9cb05c5f1e32bffaed&file_name=distributed_messageboard.zip

HINT: It's very easy to fulfill the minimum requirements. Contributions that fulfill only the minimum requirements can still get 90% of the points. (10% are for creative solutions)

 

1. Build an interesting channel for the distributed message board:

    Implement some chatbot for your channel, i.e. messages will not only be provided by users but also generated automatically
    It's totally up to you to come up with some interesting ideas
    Possible Examples:
        Guessing games
        ELIZA style chatbot
        Calculation bot - try to interpret input as a calculation task
        Service bot - provide some kind of statistics about the input


2. Make a fancier client

    The standard client is very simplistic. Make it fancier, somehow.

 

3. Deploy your channel and your client on the known servers

    Hub endpoint: https://temporary-server.de
    Authkey: SERVER_AUTHKEY = 'Crr-K3d-2N'
    Register your channel with the central hub.
    Play around with other groups' channels.
